                The Tree Human Generator was inspired by the question 'What does a tree human cyborg look like?'.
                It is based on a speculative future where trees are scarce and humans graft trees into their bodies for convenient CO2 filtration.
                It is part of my ongoing Thesis work at Parsons using web and game technologies to speculate alternative carbon sinks as solutions to climate change.

                I used image-generation models like craiyon to help me imagine an aesthetic for the 'tree-human' and then prototyped a tool to create 3d assets for tree human bodies.
                The generator uses the three.js and proctree.js libraries. It is open source and will be built into an online archive where people can store their creations.
