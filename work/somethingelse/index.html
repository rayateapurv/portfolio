        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            We became Something Else is a game anthology of speculative games about the earth post a space exodus.
            It consists of two games, Remains and Symbiote. 
            <br><br>
            Remains is a narrative driven game about a future Earth where most people have left for a new life in a colony on the distant planet Aurelion.
            It tells the story of the people who were left behind on the declining Earth and the messages they receive from the colony through a comm robot, Skybot.
            The dialogue for Remains is created procedurally live using text generated by a fine-tuned GPT-2 AI model.
            <br><br>
            Symbiote is an exploration game based on the planet Aurelion where people have migrated to from Earth. 
            By consuming the resources in Aurelionâ€™s alien environment, humans have begun to cultivate trees on their bodies. 
            The body of the symbiote is generated procedurally, live as the game is being played and is affected by the food the player consumes.
